Help the user set up their skill-checker.json configuration file:

1. Check if .claude/hooks/ directory exists in the current project
2. Check if .claude/hooks/skill-checker.json already exists
3. If it doesn't exist:
   - Copy the example config from ~/.claude/plugins/skill-checker/config-templates/skill-checker.example.json
   - Create it at .claude/hooks/skill-checker.json
4. Show them the config file and offer to customize it further

Be helpful and guide them through the process step by step.
